<p>Considering the potential of <q>inclusive education</q>  at <sub>your</sub>  Perhaps you are currently working in an <i>inclusive classroom</i>  and looking for effective strategies. 
<br> Lean into this deep-dive article on <b>inclusive education</b>  to gather a solid understanding of what it means, what the <sup>research</sup>  shows, and proven strategies that bring out the benefits for everyone.</p> <hr>
<p>Inclusive education is when all <i>students</i> , regardless of any challenges they may have, are placed in age-appropriate general education classes that are in their own neighborhood schools to receive high-quality instruction, interventions, and supports that enable them to meet success in the core curriculum (Bui, Quirk, Almazan, & Valenti, 2010; Alquraini & Gut, 2012).

    The school and  <del> classroom <i>operate on the</i>  premise</del> that <b>students</b>  with disabilities are <br> as fundamentally competent as students without disabilities. Therefore, all students can be full participants in their classrooms and in the local school community. Much of the movement is related to legislation that students receive their education in the least restrictive environment (LRE). This means they are with their peers without disabilities to the maximum degree possible, with general education the placement of first choice for all students (Alquraini & Gut, 2012).
    
    Successful  <q>inclusive  education</q>  happens <sub>primarily through accepting</sub> , understanding, and attending to student differences and diversity, which can include physical, cognitive, academic, social, and emotional. This is not to say that students never need to spend time out of regular education classes, because sometimes they do for a very particular purpose — for instance, for speech or occupational therapy. But the goal is this should be the exception.
    
   <b>The driving principle</b>  is to make all <sup>student</sup> s feel welcomed, appropriately challenged, and supported in their efforts. It’s also critically important that the adults are supported, too. <hr> This includes the regular education teacher and the special education teacher, as well as all other staff and faculty who are key stakeholders — and that also includes parents.</p> <blockquote>DISABLED CHILDREN</blockquote>
